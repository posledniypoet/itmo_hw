AND I DO APPRECIATE YOU BEING ROUND
but now these days are gone Im not so self assured
Help1 I need somebody

Help me if you can Im feeling down

I never needed anybodys help in any way
 Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors
When I was younger so much younger than today
Wont you please please help me
